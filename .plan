scrape the data
---------------

use scrapy
west-bound schedule
able to extract items with td id, depart_time
  id is in the form: td<number>-<number
  I need to filter the list where id starts with "td" and ends with "-4"
  xpath matches does not work since apparently scrapy only uses xpath 1.0
  scrapy crawl rtd -o items.json

[x] west-bound (W) schedule (depart times from Auraria West)
[x] north-bound (E) schedule (depart times from 10th/Osage, arrival times at Auraria West)
[x] north-bound (C) schedule (depart times from 10th/Osage, arrival times at Auraria West)
  figure out how to also scrape the north-bound C schedule in a different spider
[x] extract for M-H, F, S, S/H

item fields:
route
depart_time (from 10th and Osage)
arrive_time (to Auraria West)

Route W arrive_time is to Golden Station (can be null; because W stops short at Federal sometimes)
Routes C and E have both arrive/depart

store the data
--------------

[x] convert time "[0-9]i{4}[A|P]" -> "[0-9]{4}"
[x] "--" -> NULL
[x] verify android has built-in support for SQLite
[x] export data to SQLite from within the rtd_pipeline

data must be stored in format that an Android app can consume
  ideally, periodic checks for updated schedules...code to that in the Android app [future feature]


study the data
--------------

[ ] script that takes in [current_time], and outputs [next_depart_time], [wait_time], [travel_time]

user is at 10th/osage
  convert current time to integer format // ex. 923A -> 923

  // select first connecting train [next_connection_depart_time], [next_connection_arrive_time]
  select from schedule where route in ('C', 'E') and depart_time > [current_time] order by depart_time ASC LIMIT 1
  // list of all W trains leaving Auraria West that will arrive at Golden
  // first record is the soonest W train [closest_depart_time]
  select from schedule where route = 'W' and depart_time > [current_time] and arrive_time <> NULL order by depart_time ASC LIMIT 1
  // first record is the soonest W train after connection is made [connection_depart_time]
  select from schedule where route = 'W' and depart_time >= [next_connection_arrive_time] and arrive_time <> NULL order by depart_time ASC LIMIT 1

  we want [closest_depart_time] >= 10 and [connection_depart_time] > [closest_depart_time]
    this means you can sprint and catch the earliest possible W train leaving for Golden
  otherwise, you should stay and make connection
 
[ ] make a script to run through all possible 10th/Osage arrive times and list out total trip time; to find the min(s) 

Concrete Example 1:
  I arrive at 10th/Osage on D train at 538A [current_time].
  The next C train arrives at 556A, and arrives at Auraria West at 559A.
  The next E train arrives at 541A [next_connection_depart_time], and arrives at Auraria West at 544A [next_connection_arrive_time].  <- E is closest
  The next W train departs Auraria West at 552A [next_depart_time] (and 600A).
  
  [next_depart_time] - [current_time] = 14min
  therefore first condition met to Sprint (enough time to make it)
  
  [wait_time] = [next_connect_depart_time] (least of either C or E) - [current_time] = 3min
  [travel_time] = [next_connection_arrive_time] - [next_connection_depart_time] = 3min
  [connection_time] = [next_depart_time] - [next_connection_arrive_time] = 8min

  [total_connect_time] = [wait_time] + [travel_time] + [connection_time] = 14min

  In this case, no time is saved by sprinting, but it's a little exercise!

Concrete Example 2:
  [current_time] = 732A
  [next_connection_depart_time] = lesser of (C, 756A) or (E, 741A) = 741A
  [next_connection_arrive_time] = 744A
  [next_depart_time] = first W depart_time after [next_connection_arrive_time] where W arrive_time is not null = 752A

  [sprint_time] = [next_depart_time] - [current_time] = 20min

  [wait_time] = [next_connection_depart_time] - [current_time] = 9min
  [travel_time] = [next_connection_arrive_time] - [next_connection_depart_time] = 3min
  [connection_time] = [next_depart_time] - [next_connection_arrive_time] = 752A - 744A = 6min

  [total_connect_time] = 18min

   

NOTE: Some W trains stop short at Federal Center; so W's arrive_time  


Should I Sprint?
  does a W arrive at Auraria West >= 10min from current_time
  arrival of next C train at Auraria West 

the user got off at 10th and Osage; waiting on transfer to northbound C line, then to switch to W line
based on the current time;
determine if the user should sprint to the Auraria West station, or wait on the next northbound C train

so the "Should I Sprint?" test is: 
      the next W train departs from Auraria West in at least 10 min (the user can get there in time)
  AND the time of arrival of next northbound C train is greater than 10 min (it's worth it to sprint over)

the "Should I Wait?" test is:
      the next W train departs in less than 10 min (the user can't make it if they tried)
