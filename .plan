scrape the data
---------------

use scrapy
west-bound schedule
able to extract items with td id, depart_time
  id is in the form: td<number>-<number
  I need to filter the list where id starts with "td" and ends with "-4"
  xpath matches does not work since apparently scrapy only uses xpath 1.0
  scrapy crawl rtd -o items.json

[x] west-bound (W) schedule (depart times from Auraria West)
[ ] north-bound (E) schedule (depart times from 10th/Osage, arrival times at Auraria West)
[ ] north-bound (C) schedule (depart times from 10th/Osage, arrival times at Auraria West)
  figure out how to also scrape the north-bound C schedule in a different spider


store the data
--------------

data must be stored in format that an Android app can consume
  ideally, periodic checks for updated schedules...code to that in the Android app [future feature]


study the data
--------------

the user got off at 10th and Osage; waiting on transfer to northbound C line, then to switch to W line
based on the current time;
determine if the user should sprint to the Auraria West station, or wait on the next northbound C train

so the "Should I Sprint?" test is: 
      the next W train departs from Auraria West in at least 10 min (the user can get there in time)
  AND the time of arrival of next northbound C train is greater than 10 min (it's worth it to sprint over)

the "Should I Wait?" test is:
      the next W train departs in less than 10 min (the user can't make it if they tried)
